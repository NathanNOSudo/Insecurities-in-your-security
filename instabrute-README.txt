FIRST 2 LINES ARE IRRELEAVANT UNLESS YOU CLONE FROM GITHUB

python instabrute.py -h

Linux operating systems preffered, I personally recommend certain distros for learning digital security:
Kali Linux  
ParrotOS

Both Distros have varius tools to learn with and countless resources to learn from. Offensive Securtiy offers
many classes and certifications in OSINT fields. 

Pwnie-Express speaker - "Im the man who doesnt knock."

Its important to note this is essentially just a python script. So it really can run
on any OS. The reason I have began to revive this is due to the fact that times have 
changed again, just like they always will continue to change. The recent events in the world
have caused many companys, schools, even government offices and officials to work remotely.
I have noticed while in collaberation with people on varius projects the passwords that are being
used for different tools such as zoom meetins, admin dashboards, hosting services, and even emails
have went back to being to lax and simple even though the threat of security breach is more real then 
ever. This is a Proof of concept and a tool for educational purposes ONLY. I am not responsible for any evil, 
malicious, inapropriate uses of this tool. Be mindful of the evil uses this has and reprucussions it could 
bring to your door step. LAST WARNING THIS IS A TOOL FOR SPREADING AWARENESS. I WILL UPLOAD A VIDEO OF 
MYSELF GETTING INTO MY OWN ACCOUNT WITHIN A MATTER OF SECONDS...YES SECONDS. No need to go in any further
I will be adding many tools and resources in the hopes of spreading awareness on the subject of online
security.
