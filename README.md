# Insecurities-in-your-security


The reason I have began to revive this is due to the fact that times have changed again, just like they always will continue to change. The recent events in the world have caused many company's, schools, even government offices and officials to work remotely.

I have noticed while in collaboration with people on various projects the passwords that are being
used for different tools such as zoom meetings, admin dashboards, hosting services, and even emails

I have noticed while in collaberation with people on varius projects the passwords that are being

have went back to being to lax and simple even though the threat of security breach is more real then 
ever. This is a Proof of concept and a tool for educational purposes ONLY. I am not responsible for any evil, 
malicious, inappropriate uses of this tool. Be mindful of the evil uses this has and repercussions it could 
bring to your door step. LAST WARNING THIS IS A TOOL FOR SPREADING AWARENESS. I WILL UPLOAD A VIDEO OF 
MYSELF GETTING INTO MY OWN ACCOUNT WITHIN A MATTER OF SECONDS...YES SECONDS. No need to go in any further
I will be adding many tools and resources in the hopes of spreading awareness on the subject of online
security.


Linux operating systems preferred, I personally recommend certain distros for learning digital security:
-Kali Linux  
-ParrotOS
Both Distros have various tools to learn with and countless resources to learn from. Offensive Security offers

many classes and certifications in OSINT fields. 

Its 2020 so really you can use any OS, welcome to the world of virtual machines.

15 years ago, open source information was scarce, the times you found it easily accessible were few and far between. Finding information about companies and people was primarily done with a phone book. It’s no secret that this has changed dramatically since the dawn of the smartphone. In recent years, open source intelligence (OSINT) is has taken on a whole new meaning. It is crucial for you to develop a precise security strategy and also include a open source threat intelligence component. People of all ages and demographics have become very comfortable with openly sharing their personal data.The challenges with OSINT used to stem from the scarcity and inaccessibility of open data. Times have changed and have changed rapidly. Enter Myspace. Remember your old friend Tom? Tom is one of the many catalyst that helped create the biggest hurdle we face now, there’s so much of it to filter through. Lets take a moment to give thanks to Tom and social media. It's proper etiquette to give credit where credit is due. The growth of social media has not only changed the game for OSINT research but also made it so much easier to steal your personal data. Data is everywhere now, and the approach has changed from digging and searching for enough breadcrumbs to build a story, to taking the enormous amount of breadcrumbs abundant in our digital world and filtering it all down to the morsels that really matter.  Let me be clear, it doesn't take long to get those sweet morsels of data. For that you can go to traditional news sources such as Bing News Google - Maps, Search, Images, Facebook or any other platform. Personally i believe that linkedin should be in everyone's source folder. 
People are all just people, right? When it gets down to it everyone's the same. They love something. They want something. They fear something. Specifics help but specifics don't change the way that everyone is vulnerable. It just changes the way
